About the Extension
This extension is my amateur work. At the very beginning, I just need a tool can monitor some rogue script's requests in browser. Chrome's devtools can only inspect specific Tab's requests which doesn't meet my requirements, so there is this extension (Log function can do this). In order to increase its availability, I added features Block (block sites), HTTPS (force https connection), hotlinking (view hotlinking images) and QRCode ( two-dimensional code). And later with the user's feedback, the killer feature custom (custom URL) was added. This extension is open source. If you have any questions in use, please send me an e-mail feedback.

```js
let org = {
    // preprocess markdown file
    test: /\.md$/,
    loader: 'vue-markdown-loader',
    options: {
      wrapper: 'article'
    }
  }
```
